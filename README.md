Project Title:
Hangman - Java Console Game

Description:
A simple hangman game written in Java.
The program picks a random Marvel character from a list, then the player must guess the word letter by letter.
Each incorrect guess removes a part of the hangman. When all part are removed the player loses.
This is my first Java project it was made to practice loops, conditionals, classes, and general Java fundementals.

Features:
1- Random Marvel superhero word
2- Input validation
3- Tracks guessed letters
4- Hangman pieces removed after incorrect guess
5- Win/Lose detection
6- Replay option

Why I made this:
I created this project to practice Java fundementals outside of class and build a small, complete game from scratch. 
It helped me improve my understading of loops, conditionals, arrays, and object oriented structure.
